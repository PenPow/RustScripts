## About

This repository contains the source code for all mini-projects that I have worked on while attempting to learn a new programming language.

This is similar to my [other repository](https://github.com/PenPow/PythonScripts) (containing scripts written while doing python GCSE).

Eventually I am going to make another repository for when I want to learn Golang, but for now, we have this!
